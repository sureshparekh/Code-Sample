# Python and Computational Physics Courses

Welcome to the repository containing three courses aimed at introducing you to Python programming and computational physics concepts. Each course is presented as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file), which can be run using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Notebooks:

### Google Colab:

Google Colab is a free cloud-based platform that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks in the browser. To run the notebooks in this repository using Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Click on the notebook file you want to open.
2. In the top right corner of the page, click on the "Open in Colab" button.
3. The notebook will open in a new tab on Google Colab. You can now run the code cells and interact with the notebook.

### Jupyter Notebook:

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. To run the notebooks locally using Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Download the notebook file to your local machine.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the notebook file, and run the command `jupyter notebook`.
4. A new browser window will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Click on the notebook file to open it and start running the code cells.
